# Sourcery_Project
Python method name prediction using different Deep Learning models.

There are two main entry points to this repositories depanding on what you want to achieve: either training or hyperparameter search. For evaluation of models, please refer to our <a href="https://github.com/UgoBena/Evaluation-Tool-For-Method-Naming" target="_blank">Specific Tool</a>.

Data for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet#downloading-data-from-s3" target="_blank">here</a>. It is the data from the <a href="https://github.blog/2019-09-26-introducing-the-codesearchnet-challenge/" target="_blank">CodeSearchNet Challenge</a> and you only need to download the python files. The resulting python folder should be placed in a data/ folder at the root of the project. Make sure that config.py (and especially the data_folder line) is updated accordingly.

This work is part of an Msc Final Project done at Imperial College London for the Msc Computing (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning).
